# Nouns on a Phone

A fun party game iOS app built with SwiftUI where teams take turns guessing words through different challenges.

## Game Overview

"Nouns on a Phone" is a multiplayer word-guessing game with three exciting rounds:

1. **Round 1: Describe the Word** - Describe the word to your team without saying the word itself

## üö® To-Do: App Store Readiness

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (HIGH PRIORITY - Must Fix Before Submission)

#### üî• **Critical Bugs**
- [ ] **Fix Missing Implementation**: `WordInputView.swift:86` calls `gameState.addSampleWords(count: 5)` but method doesn't exist

  - **Impact**: Runtime crash
  - **Fix**: Implement the missing method
- [ ] **Remove Debug Code**: Remove all `print("[DEBUG]...")` statements from production code
  - **Files**: `GameModels.swift` (lines 229, 340, 408, 475-482)
  - **Impact**: Professional code quality
- [ ] **Fix Audio Settings Coupling**: Background music and sound effects are unnecessarily linked
  - **File**: `SoundManager.swift:129`
  - **Fix**: Allow independent control of background music and sound effects

#### üì± **App Store Requirements**
- [ ] **Update Bundle Identifier**: Change from `com.example.Fishbowl-v2` to unique identifier
  - **File**: Project settings
  - **Impact**: App Store submission requirement
